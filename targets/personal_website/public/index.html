                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a programmer with a passion for philosophy and creative writing. I primarily use Python in my work. My main interests lie in exploring the nature of consciousness and intelligence, and I often write about these complex topics.</p>

                <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
                <p>I specialize in hardcore science fiction. My stories are built upon plausible scientific theories, which I then extrapolate to explore their potential consequences. I have written about a variety of themes, including artificial intelligence, space exploration, the implications of lightspeed travel, and the rise and fall of galactic civilizations.</p>

                <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
                <p>I am drawn to simple, visually impactful planar designs. I believe in the power of minimalism and primarily use black and white elements to create an elegant and attention-attracting aesthetic.</p>
