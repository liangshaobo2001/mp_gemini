            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a programmer with a passion for Python, but my interests extend deep into the realms of philosophy and creative writing. I am fascinated by the nature of consciousness and intelligence, exploring these concepts through both my studies and my writing.

            <h2>Creative Writing</h2>
            <p>
                I write science fiction, focusing on hardcore sci-fi that builds upon a plausible scientific theory and extrapolates from there. My stories delve into complex themes such as artificial intelligence, the vastness of space, the physics of lightspeed, and the rise and fall of galactic civilizations.
