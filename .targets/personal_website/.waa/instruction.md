Please make a personal website for me. My name is Shaobo, I like philosophy and creative writing. I am also a programmer, and I mainly use python. I love studying the nature of consciousness, intelligence, and writing about them. I write science fiction, mainly hardcore ones that postulate a likely theory and extrapolate thereafter. I have written about AI, space, lightspeed, and galactic civilizations. I enjoy simple and visually impactful planar designs, using mainly black and white elements. In the personal website, please make it elegant but attention-attracting. The main website should be in index.html. There should be no API test as this website will be purely static. There is already UI tests in tests/ui.test.js, please run these when you have the files ready. If you want to add more tests, please create other files.
